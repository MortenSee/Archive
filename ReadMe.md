This repository is a collection of most of the code i wrote during my bachelor degree.
It is written in various different programming languages including but not limited to Python, Javascript, Racket, and Prolog.
Comments and other embellishments are mostly written in german and wont be translated as these were originally intended for the courses i attended.
