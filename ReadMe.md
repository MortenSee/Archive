# __Archive__
This repository is a collection of most of the code i wrote during my bachelor degree.
It is written in various different programming languages including but not limited to Python, Javascript, Racket, and Prolog.
Comments and other embellishments are mostly written in german and wont be translated as these were originally intended for the courses i attended.

## Structure
I've sorted the files by programming language instead of creation date to make archiving easier. 
Prolog and Racket files were created for my university courses, Python for a machine learning project at the university and Matlab for my bachelors thesis.
The javascript files were the start of my javascript learning experience and not part of any university module.
